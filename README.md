# **K++ Means Clustering Algorithm** 🔍📊

An improved version of the traditional **K-Means Clustering** algorithm using **K++ Means** for better centroid initialization, leading to improved clustering performance and faster convergence.

## **Features** 🚀
✅ **Enhanced Initialization** - Uses K++ Means for better centroid selection.  
✅ **Faster Convergence** - Reduces the number of iterations compared to K-Means.  
✅ **Improved Accuracy** - Produces more stable and accurate clusters.  
✅ **Visualization Support** - Graphical representation of cluster formation.  
✅ **Flexible Parameters** - Customizable number of clusters and iterations.  

## **Technologies Used** 🛠️
- **Python**  
- **NumPy** (for numerical computations)  
- **Matplotlib** (for visualizing clusters)  
- **Scikit-learn** (for dataset handling and comparison)  
- **Pandas** (for data manipulation)  

## **Installation** 🔧
1️⃣ **Clone the repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/navami27/Clustering-Improvisation.git
cd kplusplus-clustering
```  
2️⃣ **Install dependencies**  
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn pandas
```  
3️⃣ **Run the algorithm**  
```bash
python kmeans.py
```  

## **How It Works** 🎬
1. **Dataset is loaded** and preprocessed.  
2. **Centroids are initialized** using the K++ Means method.  
3. **Clusters are formed** based on the nearest centroids.  
4. **Centroids are updated iteratively** until convergence.  
5. **Final clusters are visualized** using Matplotlib.  

## **Comparison with K-Means** 📈
| Feature | K-Means | K++ Means |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Centroid Initialization | Random | Smart selection |
| Convergence Speed | Slower | Faster |
| Cluster Stability | Less stable | More stable |
| Accuracy | Moderate | Higher |



## **Future Enhancements** 🔮
- Implement parallel computing for faster execution.  
- Add support for different distance metrics.  
- Test on large-scale datasets.
